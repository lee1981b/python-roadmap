# Arithmetic in Python.

**Arithmetic operations** are the basic mathematical operations that form the foundation of many programs.  
Python supports standard operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

### Common Operators.
- `+` : Addition  
- `-` : Subtraction  
- `*` : Multiplication  
- `/` : Division (float result)  
- `//` : Floor division (integer result)  
- `%` : Modulus (remainder)  
- `**` : Exponentiation  

### Example.
```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # 13
print(a / b)   # 3.333...
print(a // b)  # 3
print(a ** b)  # 1000
```
