# Python Roadmap

A structured learning path and reference for Python concepts, built as I progress through my studies and projects.  
This roadmap is organized into directories with definitions, examples, and custom scripts for practice.  

---

## üìÇ Directory Structure

- **`arithmetic/`**  
  Basic mathematical operations in Python (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).  

- **`functions/`**  
  Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.  

- **`methods/`**  
  Functions associated with objects (e.g., string methods, list methods).  

- **`classes/`**  
  Blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating attributes and methods.  

- **`custom_scripts/`**  
  Standalone Python scripts combining functions, classes, and methods to solve real tasks.  

---

## üöÄ Usage

Clone the repository and explore each section:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lee1981b/python-roadmap.git
cd python-roadmap
```

Each directory has its own README.md with definitions and examples.
You can run or adapt the example scripts using Python 3:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

üéØ Goal.
To build a personal Python reference library, adding definitions, examples, and scripts while working through Python books and hands-on projects.
This roadmap grows daily as new concepts are learned and practiced.

üìö Sources of Learning.
Python books (e.g., Python Crash Course, Black Hat Python, Cracking Codes with Python).
Online resources and documentation.
Personal experiments and custom projects.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Plans.
Expand examples in each section.
Add advanced topics (decorators, generators, context managers, etc.).
Build out more custom scripts for automation and security projects.
