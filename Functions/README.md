# Functions in Python.

A **function** in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.  
Functions help organize programs into smaller, manageable pieces, reduce repetition, and improve readability.

### Syntax.
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    """Docstring describing the function."""
    # code block
    return result
```

### Example.
```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a personalized greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
