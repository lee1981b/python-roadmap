# Methods in Python.

A **method** in Python is a function that is associated with an object.  
Methods are called on objects to perform actions or return information about the objectâ€™s data.

### Example.
```python
text = "hello world"

print(text.upper())   # HELLO WORLD
print(text.capitalize())  # Hello world
print(text.replace("world", "Python"))  # hello Python
```

Here, .upper(), .capitalize(), and .replace() are methods belonging to the string object.
